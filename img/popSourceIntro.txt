Population projections and historical data are based on two sources. The first source is the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) v3 from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), Columbia University, which contains estimates of global population density for 1990, 1995 and 2000 with a resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes. The population density is resampled to a 30 arc-second resolution (approx. 1km), and data covering 9 Niger River basin countries from 0 degrees to 30N, 30W to 30E are extracted. The second source is the Shared Social Path (SSP) population projections of Moss et al. (2010), which contains per country population projections until 2100 at 5 year intervals. The aggregate population numbers are spatially distributed into gridded data based on scaling the SEDAC 2000 population density data. A fixed set of population projection based on an exponential growth model is also generated using growth rates ranging from 1 to 5 percent.
